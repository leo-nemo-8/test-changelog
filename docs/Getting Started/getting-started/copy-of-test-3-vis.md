## Audience

<Accordion title="5. Define the target audience for your campaign in the Audience section." icon="fa-users">

The **Audience** section lets you select who to target your App Push. It has the following sections:

### Target Audience

Choose a specific segment or list to define the audience for the App push campaign. Pick up to five user segments or lists. Use for targeting based on historical behavior captured by server-side user segments.


<Image src="https://files.readme.io/40d970c8a6c2a749816a481d0b2e15796eeb42587eadac1f49e56a877c8bf14f-TargetAudience.png" alt="Select your target audience for the campaign" align="center" width="80% " caption="Select your target audience for the campaign" border={true} />


**Target Audience** has the following options:

- **All Contacts**: Target all users in your contact list when creating campaigns.

<AllContactsEnableOrDisable />

- **Segments/List**: Select from existing lists or segments to target specific contacts. Search for the desired segment or list by name and add it to your campaign with a checkbox selection.
- **Ad-hoc segment**: This lets you instantly create segments, view user counts, and integrate them into your campaign targeting.
- **User data table (UDT)**: This is a specialized collection of contact information that includes additional attributes such as email addresses, physical addresses, and other personal details. UDT provides detailed information about contacts to help personalize and target campaigns.

### Exclude Contacts

Select suppression segments or lists to exclude specific users from campaign targeting. You can select up to 15 segments or lists for exclusion.

  - The journey end time must be less than or equal to the timer or progress bar end-time.
  - The timer can run for a maximum of 24 hours. If the journey exceeds this, users may receive expired timer notifications.
  - The **TTL** (**Time To Live**) must not exceed the timer or progress bar endtime. If it does, notifications may be delivered after the timer has expired, showing the timer end message to users.

Toggle on **Add-on options** to enable custom key value and collapse notifications.


<Image src="https://files.readme.io/486042ea708fbab475603257f5ed717343575e034f12d99c03ee22861bbf1950-AddOnOptions.png" alt="Enable custom key value and collapse notifications" align="center" width="80% " caption="Enable custom key value and collapse notifications" border={true} />


- **Collapse Notification**

This feature is used by FCM (Firebase Cloud Messaging) and APNS (Apple Push Notification Service) to update older notifications that have already been delivered. When multiple notifications share the same collapse key, only the most recent one will appear in the user's notification tray.<br />For example, if you send a series of cricket match score updates, you can set **score_updates** as the collapse key. This ensures that only the latest score update is visible in the user's notification tray.

- **Custom Key-Value Pairs**

In this section, you can define custom key-value pairs specific to the operating system. These pairs trigger actions within the app when a user interacts with a notification, enabling personalized experiences.<br />For example, a shopping app can use a key-value pair like **Key**: category and **Value**: shoes to direct users to the shoes section when they click a notification about a shoe sale.

<Callout icon="📘" theme="info">
  ### Note

  - At least one operating system must be selected.
  - You can add up to 49 key-value pairs

# Copy From iOS/Android

To make App Push creation faster and more flexible, you have the option to copy common content between Android and iOS while configuring your push notification. This enhancement removes dependency to manually duplicate the same content across platforms.

<Callout icon="👍" theme="okay">
  ### Important Points to Remember

  - Choose both an Android and an iOS app while setting up campaign to enable **Copy from Android/iOS** option.
  - When copying content between platforms, only field values are copied. Field **enablement** or **disablement** is not synced. For exampIe, if a field is disabled on Android but enabled on iOS, it will remain enabled on iOS after using Copy from Android.
</Callout>

### Steps to enable copy to iOS/Android

1. Configure content on one platform (Android or iOS).
2. Switch to the other platform tab.
3. Click Copy from Android or Copy from iOS and confirm the action in the modal.

_Copying content overwrites common fields in the destination platform._ Refer to the table below to understand which set of content can be copied:

| Category                  | Fields                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Common content fields** | <ul><li>Title</li><li>Subtitle</li><li>Body message</li><li>Image / GIF URL</li><li>Background color</li><li>CTA text</li><li>CTA URL / action link</li></ul> |
| **Carousel card fields**  | Card title<li>Card description<li>Card image URL<li>Card CTA                                                                                                  |

Refer to the table below to understand which set of content cannot be copied and has to be manually entered:

| Category                       | Fields                                                                                                                                                                                  |

      <td>
        Select this option to schedule push notifications directly on users' devices. When enabled, it ensures notifications are sent to almost 100% of your active users. Active users are those who come online from the time an app push campaign is scheduled until it is set to display on their device. Notifications can be delivered through **FCM** and **Push Amplification** if the user comes online during the scheduled period.

        **Points to remember**: <ol><li>This options is only avilable when you select **Send later** option..</li><li> Schedule your campaign 24 hours before using this feature.</li><li> When local notifications are stored on a user's device, they cannot be recalled if the campaign is suspended.</li></ol>

  ### Important

  Running two consecutive campaigns within 30 minutes, the time frame could bypass the frequency cap check due to data synchronization delay.

  For example, if you schedule one app push at 12:00 pm and another at 12:30 pm with a frequency cap limiting users to one app push per day. In this case, the second push notification may not reach users due to the frequency cap settings.
