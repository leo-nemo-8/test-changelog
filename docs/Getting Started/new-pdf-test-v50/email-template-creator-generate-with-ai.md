   ```

6. Review the generated template and refine the template using follow-up prompts. For example, "Make the tone friendly", "Change the CTA to focus on urgency", and so on.

7. (Optional) Customize the layout in the Email Editor after the template is generated. For example,
   - Edit text directly in the visual editor.
   - Add or remove sections, images, or buttons.
   - Replace AI-generated copy with custom messaging where needed.

Save the generated template to reuse individual sections or the entire template in future campaigns. You can also retrieve any previous version by clicking **Click to restore this version**.&#x20;

# Customize Template for Brand Consistency

Email Template Creator agent supports integration with [Brand Kit](doc:brand-kit) to help you maintain consistent branding across all messages. Using this feature, you can apply pre-defined visual assets, color palettes, and typography to maintain brand consistency across campaign messages.&#x20;

# Manage Generated Templates

All AI-generated templates will be saved under the _Saved Templates_ section of the email editor, and images generated as a part of this process can be accessed via [AI Generated Images Folder](doc:image-creator).

# Threads

Once you start generating Templates, it automatically saves your sessions under the <img src="https://files.readme.io/a973e47e78d9cb32bf7c2372bc46d90fdb6f8eb16dd6ebaa77a63c2b385438c8-Threads_icon.png" valign="middle" height="20"> panel. Each session is stored as a **thread**, which captures your prompts, refinements, and generated outputs, helping you resume from where you left off without losing context.

### How Threads Work

Threads are scoped to your **Account**, **Agent**, and **User**, ensuring that your history remains personalized and relevant. All threads for your account appear in the **All Threads** popup. A thread becomes the context for your next generation, allowing CleverAI <sup>TM</sup> to remember your prior visual style, brand preferences, or edits. They are not tied to specific campaigns; they persist across multiple campaigns for seamless continuity.

If multiple users from the same account use AI tools, each user sees only their own threads and the latest template generation session that they have participated in.

### Manage Threads

From the **All Threads** view, you can:

- Reopen an older thread to continue generating or editing templates using the same context.
- Review and compare multiple template versions created during that session.
- Restore or reuse previously generated templates without regenerating them.

<Callout icon="💡" theme="default">
  #### **Tip**

  For subsequent edits, you need not restart a session. You can type your next instruction directly in the chat. For example: _“Make the background blue and add a 50% OFF badge in the corner.”_ The AI will update the existing template while maintaining your brand styling and earlier visual tone.
